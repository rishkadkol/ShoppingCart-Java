# 🛒 Online Shopping Cart (Java)

## 📌 Overview
This is a **console-based shopping cart system** written in **Java**.  
It demonstrates key programming concepts such as:  
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)  
- ✅ Exception Handling with custom exceptions  
- ✅ Category & product selection  
- ✅ Discounts applied per category  

This project is simple but **extendable** — you can later add GUI (JavaFX), database (MySQL/SQLite), or even turn it into a REST API.
